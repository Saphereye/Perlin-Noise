# Perlin-Noise

An experiment into the vast world of procedural generation. 
I made this program to try to understand how procedural generation might be working.

Thought Process:
THe main idea was to combine various periodic functions together to make a terrain-like generation.
For this project I have used sin(Î¸) function as center of experiment.
The results were helpful in giving a glimpse of periodic genration.
